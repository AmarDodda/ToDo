# React + Vite

This task involves creating a todo list application in React, managing state for todos, input values, and filter options. Users can add new todos, delete existing ones, and update their status using the dropdown Filter.

 Todos are displayed as cards with light green backgrounds, and "Edit" and "Delete" buttons are positioned at the bottom right corner of each card for easy access. Additionally, users can filter todos based on their completion status.
